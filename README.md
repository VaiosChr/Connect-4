# Connect-4

This is an implementation of the famous game **"Connect 4"**. 

Connect Four (also known as Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Captain's Mistress, Four in a Row, Drop Four, and Gravitrips in the Soviet Union) is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.

The board sizes are adjustable, i.e. 10x10, 20x18 etc. Also, the 2nd player can be switched to an A.I. that makes the moves automatically, by using the min-max algorithm, with alpha-beta pruning. The player can choose the suitable min-max searching depth, to adjust the difficulty of the game.
